Concept for UHS clubs kickoff/clubapalooza currency

## The Problem

Clubs kickoff and clubapalooza transactions are handled through paper tickets - a medium of currency that brings many issues.

The issues with tickets:

* easy to lose
* easy to forge
* difficult to audit and track
* tedious to count

## The Solution

This concept which I have been exploring solves these many issues with a digital cryptocurrency-like platform.

## Features

* Mobile-centric application that allows both vendors and buyers to easily conduct transactions
  * QR-codes will facilitate account identification for easy transactions
* Many ways to validate the adding of the cryptocurrency into accounts
* Blockchain-managed state allows easy auditing and enforces transparency of transactions
* Impossible for others to fake/phish tokens/money (as opposed to the previous tickets, which have the potential of being fake)
* Digitally-managed transactions are easy to keep track of, since statistics can be digitally counted

### Process

*Vendors*:

* Scan customers' QR codes on their phones to easily conduct transactions
* Add in shop-items for one/two-tap purchases

*Buyers*:

* QR-code based account that, when scanned, provides the information necessary to conduct a transaction
* Requires validation on both ends to purchase (simple modal that asks the user to confirm purchase)

## Obstacles

Users who do not have access to a cellular/mobile device can use a physical card-like object with a QR code that will serve as the "account" card.
